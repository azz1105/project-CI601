		        <br>1-Be suspicious of unsolicited emails or messages. Phishing attacks often come from unknown senders or are disguised as urgent messages from legitimate sources. If you're not expecting a message or it seems suspicious, don't click on any links or attachments.<br>

				<br>2-Check the sender's email address. Scammers often use email addresses that look similar to legitimate ones, so be sure to examine the sender's email address carefully. Legitimate companies will often use a recognizable email domain, such as "@amazon.com" or "@paypal.com."<br>

				<br>3-Look for signs of a scam. Phishing emails may contain spelling or grammar mistakes, generic greetings, or suspicious requests for personal information. Be wary of any message that seems too good to be true or requires urgent action.<br>

				<br>4-Don't click on links or download attachments. Phishing attacks often include links to malicious websites or infected attachments. Instead of clicking on links, visit the website directly by typing the URL into your browser. Before downloading an attachment, scan it with an antivirus program.<br>

				<br>5-Keep your software up-to-date. Software vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to install malware or steal information. Keep your operating system, web browser, and antivirus software up-to-date to protect against known vulnerabilities.<br>

				<br>6-Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Use unique and complex passwords for each of your online accounts, and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This can make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your accounts.<br>

		      <div class="accordion-body">
		        <br>1-Use strong and unique passwords. Create complex passwords for all of your online accounts and use a different password for each account. This way, if one account is compromised, your other accounts will remain secure.<br>

				<br>2-Enable two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a code in addition to your password. This code is typically sent to your phone or email.<br>

				<br>3-Keep your software up-to-date. Keep your operating system, web browser, and other software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. This will help protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits.<br>

				<br>4-Use antivirus software. Install and use reputable antivirus software on your devices. This can help detect and remove malware and other threats.<br>

				<br>5-Be cautious of phishing scams. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links or attachments. Always double-check the sender's email address and look for signs of a scam.<br>

				<br>6-Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN can help protect your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and masking your IP address. This can help prevent hackers and other third parties from intercepting your data.<br>

				<br>7-Practice safe browsing habits. Avoid visiting untrustworthy websites or downloading software from unverified sources. Only use secure websites that use encryption (https://) and always double-check the URL before entering sensitive information.<br>
